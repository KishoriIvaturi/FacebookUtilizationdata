problem Scenario

Facebook, Inc. is an American social media conglomerate corporation, founded on February, 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg.

People from all age groups are connected with each other through facebook.

However, there are certain differences in the way of using it, let's say sending friend requests, sending likes, comments etc.

Let's say they want to study and analyze these differences and identify the pattern out of it.

This is result will help the company to utilize these patterns in the next set of iteration development.

Maybe this hidden pattern could end up improving their application and the user experience.
